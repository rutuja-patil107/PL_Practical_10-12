            <p>I know something about you without knowing you. I bet you spend A LOT of time in your head.

                You know, thinking, worrying, stressing, freaking out — call it whatever you want. I call it a
                preoccupied mind. And with what?
                <br>

                99% of your thoughts are useless. William James put it best:<br>

                “A great many people think they are thinking when they are merely rearranging their prejudices.”<br>

                All my life I’ve been obsessed with practical things. Practical philosophy, practical knowledge,
                practical books, practical work, and practical advice.

                That idea comes from Pragmatism, a philosophical tradition that started in the 19th century in America.
                Charles Sanders Peirce, who was a Harvard professor, is considered as the “father of Pragmatism.” …

                Mental toughness means you’re good at dealing with the demands of life. It means you can perform under
                pressure. I’ve been researching this topic extensively since the start of this year.

                I found a 2019 study that looked into the relationship between different personality traits that
                determine our mental toughness. The authors studied professional athletes and found five personality
                traits that were predictive of success in sports.

                While these findings are not very solid or applicable to daily life, I found their list of five
                personality traits highly useful. We can use these traits as a guideline for gaining more mental
                toughness. …

            <p>There’s this idea in Eastern and Western philosophy that we must learn how to enjoy the present moment
                without getting distracted by the past or future.

                Ever since the invention of words, the human race has been lost in thought. We are constantly thinking,
                stressing, worrying, and being preoccupied with a force that seems outside of our control.
                <br>
                That’s why many of us search for refuge in philosophies that promise us inner calm. Stoicism,
                Mindfulness, Zen — most of us use the teachings to escape our thoughts.

                We keep on treating the symptoms by using meditation apps, reading comfortable books and articles,
                getting rid of our devices, and trying the next solution that promises peace from ourselves. …
